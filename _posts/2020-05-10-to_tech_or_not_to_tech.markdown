Honestly, If you talked to me two years ago and said, "Emery, you will be going to school for software engineering." I would have responded with, "Survey says, 'That was a lie.'" I was trying to figure out how to be one of the most influential makeup artist in Atlanta. Now I am here racking my brain through The First Mile trying to obtain the light at the end of the tunnel. The interesting part is that, the end of the tunnel is constantly extending because even after I graduate I will be a student. The growth within my self is worth me learning to tech amognst other reasons.
