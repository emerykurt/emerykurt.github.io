If you have completed ES6 JavaScript then you get my title. 

I am have completed my Final Assesment! Which means:

```
export class FinalBlog extends Component{
    state = {
        topic: ' ',
        title: ' ',
        paragraph: ' ',
        conclusion: ' ',
              }
              
        addTopic = ( ) => {
         this.setState({
             topic:  ' Final Blog '
         })
        }
              
        addTopic = ( ) => {
         this.setState({
             title: ' The Last of {this.chapter}'
         })
        }
              
        addTopic = ( ) => {
         this.setState({
             paragraph: 'I am using this function to write my blog. It is like a silent blog because the code speaks for it self. ' 
         })
        }
              
        addTopic = ( ) => {
         this.setState({
             conclusion:  'If you put this in your code you will get the blog, once you console.log your state'
         })
        }
              
        console.log(this.state) 
 }
```
